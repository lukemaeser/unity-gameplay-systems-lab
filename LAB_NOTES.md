# Lab Notes

Small, runnable Unity labs with short notes on what I built, how to try it, and how I verified it works.

Each entry includes a scene path. Open the scene, press Play, and follow the controls listed (see README for full project setup).

## Best of (start here)
- TBD (I’ll add my top 3–5 labs here once there are a few)
